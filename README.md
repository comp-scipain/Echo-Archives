Our API will be centered around health and fitness tracking. It can collect and manage data like heart rate, calorie intake, and steps, providing users with insights into their health. Users can input their diet to track their daily calorie intake, and set fitness goals to meet. We'll use Python flask for creating the endpoints and supabase as our database.
